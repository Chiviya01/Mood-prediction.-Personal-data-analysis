## General Information
In this project, I tried to define happiness and depression from a more scientific point of view. 
Since our mood affects our productivity at work or school, our communication with others, and of course our health I decided to undertake it.
I completed this research project by predicting mood states by using various ML models. These models were trained on my personal data which included the most important factors influencing our mood. (Weather, physical actvity, nutrition, social life, stress, menstrual cycle and some others). 
To collect the data I used different data sources.
1. Period and Ovulation tracker (Clue). (from this application I obtained my target attribute - mood feature)
2. Nutrition trackig app (FatSeret)
3. Apple Health
4. Smart Scales (Renpho)
5. Google Calendar
6. Historical weather data (Met Éireann)
My dataset in the end had data only for 6 days.

### The purpose of the project
The initial idea of this project was to outline the factors that could possibly affect the mood state. The main goal was to find out what can be changed in the everyday lifestyle to become happier and decrease the risk of mental illnesses.
One of the application of this project is to provide some insights in order to improve the user’s mood.
Another use case is primarily aimed at identifying the user’s potential depression.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project was trying to find an answer to one of the eternal questions. ‘What is happiness?’ ‘What makes us happy?’ In my opinion, this is more of a philosophical question, but I chose to approach this from a more scientific point of view.
